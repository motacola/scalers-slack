Open,,,"So, what was done today: 1) Added new tracking scripts to the landing pages. Now, if the user accesses the LPs from certain sources, UTMs will appear automatically. Note: This doesn't work across the entire internet. Only the browser is tracked. So, sources like email, messages, Slack, if they don't have a UTM applied to the link, will appear blank in GHL. 2) Homepage script review: there were no errors, but I tried to make some improvements to the ""source,"" but it didn't work. I'll create a new form in GHL and insert it into the website; this way, all forms on the website will be 100% GHL, avoiding interference. 3) There are several traffic sources: forms on the website, Calendly calendars, etc. Not all can be 100% integrated, but I'll investigate further. Calendly, for example, isn't applying UTMs (automatically). 4) As I said, there are some limitations regarding knowing exactly where the lead comes from. This company has a forms system that uses AI to identify the source, but it could be a solution in the future: <https://withsurface.com/product/forms-and-workflows|>. <@U07AQ2K1U7J|Lisa Appleby> <@U05UTGNRREX> <@U0A6MGN9S77|Christopher Belgrave> cc <@U08RRG2N6AC|Eloise>",mpdm-eloise--lisa--francisco--christopher--kmalloy-1,francisco,,https://quickerleads.slack.com/archives/C0ABJUAK9MY/p1769721393530799,slack_search
